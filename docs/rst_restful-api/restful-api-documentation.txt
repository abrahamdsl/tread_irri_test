Mini-documentation of RESTful API for access to database
=========================================================

This document outlines the nouns we have identified from the given
specifications, and the operations we deem to be important for the
relevant manipulations. Also, the corresponding columns and data
types in the database are identified and now defined accordingly.

As of the above-release name, only a handful of APIs were made.

==========================================================
 
* country
Country/territory, as per ISO-3166-2.

	country_id : character_varying(2)
	country_shorthand : character_varying(50)
	country_formal : character_varying(255)
	descr: text

	Tests:
		target uniqueness of each field. i.e., try adding india or indonesia twice s - should not be allowed.
		delete an entry when it is being referenced from other tables - should not be allowed.
	
	Dependencies:
		Should create corresponding 'unspecified' placeholder in district and village tables, begining with 999 for district_id and village_id
	
	GET /
	- lists all
	GET /<two-alpha-numeric-char-case-agnostic>
	 - returns information about the country, with
	 <two-alpha-numeric-char-case-agnostic> being the internal representation of the variety
	<creation/modification/deletion not priority, basing on already fixed ISO-3166-2>

	descr: text
	
	Tests:
		target uniqueness of each field. i.e., 
			try adding rice or cassave twice - should not be allowed.
